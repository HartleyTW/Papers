## Summary 
This paper aims to discover biases in datasets based on the
representations the CNN learns. They use datasets that are labeled with
attributes (CelebA and SUN) and then mine and compare the attribute
relationships.

Ground truths between the attributes are labeled by hand.

Their method allows batch discovery of biases rather than having to comb through
individual images.

Three experiments are proposed: 

1) mining biased attribute representation

2) Creation of manually biased datasets to test the technique on

3) Using for discovery of blind spots and failure modes.


## Takeaways

I found this quite a difficult paper to follow. I do like their use of failure
mode discovery though.
